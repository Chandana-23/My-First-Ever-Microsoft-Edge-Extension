# My-First-Ever-Microsoft-Edge-Extension
## This edge extension will add humor to the programmer while coding.

I'm happy to share that my Microsoft Edge extension has passed and got published in Edge Store.

>Link to add the extension from edge store => [Random Jokes](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/random-jokes/ibbbidgkemjjpflockphjnbniknpckfg)

This extension is only for entertainment purpose. It doesn't track user data. For every click we will get a random joke. This will boost your mood while coding.

Add this extension and have fun while coding!

Thank You.
